# ICC_ODI_Ranking
Okay so I did this project for Internshalla's competition "Python Programming". I made this project in PyCharm Community version and using Python 3.7x. The iccui.py is the main script. What this program does is that it gets the ODi ranking data of batsmen , bowlers and All Rounders and saves them to a data base (ICC_ODI_RANKING.db). The a GUI opens that lets you select the genre  (Batting , Bowling or All-Rounder) and enter any desired rank. As soon as you click get rank , the script retrieves the data associated to the rank and genre you selected and even lets your computer dictate your selection using Python Text TO Speech Module. Enjoy)
